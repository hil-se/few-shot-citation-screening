CD010438,4461416,Correction of the haemostatic defect in haemophiliacs without apparent correction of the coagulation defect.,"The evaluation of microhaematuria may be considered as a measure of the haemostatic defect of haemophiliacs in nonhaemorrhagic periods. In order to study the relationship between coagulation disorder and haemostatic defect we have administered small amounts (1 U and 3 U/kg) of AHG and of factor IX (1U/kg) to 12 haemophiliacs (20 A and 2 B) and we have examined the effects on coagulation and microhaematuria. Microhaematuria was determined by the measurement of urinary radioactivity/24 h, after infusion of autologous RBC labelled with 51-Cr, for 11 consecutive days (4 days before and 7 after the administration). Coagulation was investigated by thromboelastography, PTT, Quick's time, PCI, factor VIII and IX activity assays, fibrinogen assay, and euglobulin lysis time. During the period of investigation, the patients remained in bed. In controls, factor VIII administration did not affect microhaematuria. On the other hand, in all haemophiliacs, factor VIII and IX administration significantly reduced microhaematuria, although the administered dose was not able to modify the coagulation defect. In all subjects the reduction of microhaematuria lasted at least 5 days. The correction of the haemostatic defect, without improvement of the clotting disorder, and its persistence for several days suggest that factor VIII is involved in the composition of the vascular wall and in its functional integrity. Moreover, on the basis of these results it is possible to carry out a rational prophylaxis of the haemorrhagic episodes using small doses of factor VIII, be determining the duration of the correction of the haemostatic defect for each subject.",yes

CD010438,6474360,Effect of continuous low-dose intravenous heparin administered during operation on postoperative measurements of antithrombin III and antifactor Xa.,"A preliminary subcutaneous dose of heparin given with premedication, followed by a continuous infusion of low-dose heparin up to 2 hours after operation, was given to 20 of 40 patients undergoing major abdominal operation randomly allocated to either act as controls or receive prophylaxis. The anticoagulant effect of heparin was determined by immunologic measurements of antithrombin III (AT III) and by assay of AT III and antifactor Xa activity on postoperative days 1 and 3. Despite lowered plasma AT III levels on postoperative day 3, the patients who had received low-dose heparin had significantly increased plasma antifactor Xa activity when compared with control patients (P less than 0.05). The incidences of thrombosis within 48 hours (early deep venous thrombosis) after operation were 9 of 20 control patients and 1 of 20 patients who received prophylaxis (P less than 0.01 by Fisher's exact test). Preoperative blood samples from another group of patients undergoing major abdominal operation were examined by the thromboelastograph saline dilution test, which has previously been shown to be a predictor of the risk of early deep vein thrombosis. The patients who were considered to be at high risk were treated with low-dose heparin as before, and the low-risk patients received no prophylaxis. The high-risk patients had lower levels of AT III before operation and before heparin administration than the low-risk patients and significantly lower levels on day 3 (P less than 0.02), whereas on day 3 the high-risk patients had significantly raised levels of plasma antifactor Xa. No patient in either group developed deep vein thrombosis within 48 hours of operation.",yes

For each separator we studied the technical conditions for plasma separation, the biological characteristics of the collected plasma and the in vitro recovery of factor VIIc after preparation of cryoprecipitates. Concerning the plasma extraction rate, the HemaScience apparatus was the most efficient but values were quite similar to those obtained with the Organon Teknika machine. Contaminating cells were only found in plasma separated with the Haemonetics. Total protein and immunoglobulin levels were higher in plasma collected with the Haemonetics and HaemaScience systems. Factor VIIIc activity was comparable in plasma separated by filtration or by centrifugation while fibrinopeptide A levels were higher in plasma collected by Haemonetics. Whatever the machine, no statistical difference was observed when in vitro recovery of factor VIII was studied.",yes

Blood was obtained at 1-5 day intervals during 3 cycles: 1 cycle before treatment, 1 cycle during treatment of 2 mg Ro 6-5403 orally twice daily from cycle Day 5 through 24 and 1 cycle following treatment. Low plasma levels of progesterone and ihibition of release of luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone indicated suppression of ovulation during treatment. Prolactin levels were significantly elevated (p less than .001) during treatment. Fibrinogen concentration was significantly elevated (p less than .01) and the mean number of platelets was increased. Thromboelastography showed significantly reduced values for k-time (p less than .05) and significantly increased values for maximal amplitude (p less than .05). Thrombin time was decreased and partial thromboplastin time was significantly decreased (p less than .01) during treatment. All parameters returned to pretreatment values except thrombin time where the decrease continued to a significant difference (p less than .01). The side effects subsided after the initial day of treatment. Liver and kidney parameters remained within the physiological range.

CD010438,3781704,Recent advances of knowledge on the mechanism of action of drugs modifying the bronchial secretions.,"In order to explain the mechanism of action of drugs modifying the bronchial secretions, their subdivision into agents with a direct or an indirect action seems justified: the former primarily modify already formed secretions, whilst the latter act on the bronchial structures originating mucus. In hypersecretive states with increased viscoelasticity of mucus, a widespread therapy is represented by the use of direct reducing drugs, which act by breaking the mucofibrillar network. Among them the most important are those with free sulphydryl groups (-SH), which can break the disulphide bonds of the bronchial secretions. The mechanism of action of substances such as acetylcysteine and tiopronin, that are included in those with a direct reducing action, was already verified by researches with the modified thrombo-elastograph (MTE) and has been recently confirmed by the present authors by employing a simple biochemical method, by which the action of such drugs on the structure of serum IgM can be studied in vitro. The same method permits the classification of carbocisteine and letosteine as amongst the drugs with indirect action. From the results obtained by such in vitro experiences, the necessity to examine more closely the consequences of secondary effects which direct mucolytic agents may cause by modifying the rheological, biochemical and immunological properties of bronchial secretions has been demonstrated.",yes

Before and 2 h after the administration of placebo or 1 g ASA, venous blood samples were taken for platelet counts, thrombelastography (TEG) and tests of ADP- and epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation. The blood in which the 2-h values were determined was sampled at the highest work-load during sub-maximum exercise on a bicycle ergometer (5 min each at 50, 100 and 150 watts). ASA had no effect on the alterations of the platelets due to physical effort: the increase in the first phase of epinephrine-induced aggregation, the elevation of the platelet count and the hypercoagulability demonstrable by TEG still persisted after the administration of ASA. Some effects were noted, however, that are also observed after the administration of ASA at rest: the second phase of epinephrine-induced aggregation was suppressed and disaggregation after induction with ADP was accelerated.",yes

Based on literature and own observations.,"By means of a haemonetics 30 cell separator platelets were collected for transfusion purposes from 18 different blood donors. A median yield of 5.7 X 10(11) platelets was obtained. The yield of platelets was found to be linearly related to the donors' initial platelet counts. The procedures were standardized by using one size of bowl (225 ml), performing 10 cycles per procedure, and performing all cycles as uniformly as possible. The median time per procedure was 118 min. Mild donor reactions were seen in 8 donors (44%) consisting of circumoral tingling. The decrement in the donors' platelet count was 86 X 10(9)/1, 37% of the initial platelet counts. The choice of the bowl size of 225 ml is motivated. The absurdity of the expression of yield pe h of processing, and of yield per 1 of blood processed is discussed. Furthermore, it is shown, that neither the fall in haematocrit nor the fall in the platelet count during the procedure are linear. The formulas commonly used for calculating the blood volume and platelet extraction efficiency, which are based on these assumptions, cannot therefore, in our opinion, be used.",yes

CD010438,3196810,Fibrin elasticity and coagulation.,"Sudden increase of viscosity in former times indicated the start of coagulation. Yet its measurement destroyed the structure of coagulum. By the precursor method of thrombelastography the author 1944 found elasticity to be the essential physiological property of coagulum. In the production of elastic fibrin structure its early phase is the most efficient in this respect. The speed of prime structure formation is extremely fast in presence of enough phospholipid as well as of plasma factor XIII. Even high amounts of thrombin cannot replace one or both of these substances indispensable to grow rapidly a perfect fibrin web. This phase yet does not become effective if it is not accompanied by the orbital micro-flow of the new orbitometry method. Its shear is comparable to that in a coronary artery. The special resonance effect of the method in combination with the early phase of fibrin production is generating some kind of a physiological feed back: increasing fibrin will strengthen shear stress as long as less platelets are entangled which will reduce the elastic flexibility of fibrin web. Some kind of a ""coagulation spin effect"" in optimal combination of shear stress, phospholipid and factorXIII, will extremely fast originate a firm fibrin structure, a mechanism which may be of significance for a fast occlusion of arterial stenoses.",yes

CD010438,1129830,Simplification of the methods for adding and removing glycerol during freeze-preservation of human red blood cells with the high or low glycerol methods: biochemical modification prior to freezing.,"Simple methods have been developed for adding and removing glycerol during freeze-preservation with 20 per cent W/V glycerol at minus 150 C, or with 40 per cent W/V glycerol at minus 80 C. A one-step method with a 35 per cent W/V glycerol solution is used to prepare 20 per cent W/V glycerolized red blood cells, and a two-step method with a 57 per cent W/V glycerol solution is used to prepare 40 per cent W/V glycerolized red blood cells. The systems for washing glycerolized red blood cells have been simplified. This method consists of dilution of the thawed glycerolized red blood cells prior to recovery, followed by on-line dilution of these red blood cells with wash solutions during continuous flow centrifugation. This can be done in any of three commercially available washing systems, and they all use the same sodium chloride solutions. For the 40 per cent W/V glycerolized red blood cells, this process takes about 30 minutes and uses 2.2 to 3.2 liters of the sodium chloride solutions, whereas the 20 per cent W/V glycerolized red blood cells can be processed in about 20 minutes using 1.5 to 2.5 liters. After storage in CPD for three days at 4 C, red blood cells can be freeze-preserved with 40 per cent W/V glycerol at minus 80 C or with 20 per cent W/V glycerol at minus 150 C. When the thawed red blood cells are washed in the Fenwal Elutramatic, the IBM Blood Processor, or the Haemonetics Blood Processor and stored at 4 C in sodium chloride-glucose-phosphate for at least 24 hours before transfusion, they have excellent posttransfusion survival values and normal or slightly decreased oxygen transport function. Alternatively, these red blood cells can be rejuvenated before freeze-preservation so that their 2,3-DPG levels are increased and their affinity for oxygen is reduced. Red blood cells that are stored in CPD at 4 C for as long as 28 days can be rejuvenated with a solution containing pyruvate, inosine, glucose, phosphate, and adenine (PIGPA, Solution A) before freeze-preservation with 40 per cent W/V glycerol at minus 80 C. Any one of the above systems can be used to wash these red blood cells and they can be stored at 4 C in a sodium.",yes

None had preoperative alterations in coagulation or liver function and none were receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication. Whole blood coagulation status was quantitated using thrombelastography (TEG). Blood samples for TEG were obtained 5 min before and 15 min after induction of anesthesia, after each increment of blood loss (EBL) equalling 5% of estimated blood volume (EBV), at the end of surgery, and 2 hr post-operatively. Patients with EBL exceeding 0.15 EBV were given packed red cells and crystalloid solution. Patients with EBL less than 0.15 EBV received only crystalloid. Thrombelastography analysis showed a trend toward increased coagulability with progressive blood loss. Two of four patients with 80% loss of EBV maintained normal to enhanced coagulation status, although the other two developed clinical and thrombelastographic evidence of coagulopathy. Thrombelastography allowed rapid intraoperative diagnosis and specific treatment of loss of platelet activity in the latter two patients. We conclude that during moderate to massive blood loss, use of supplemental fresh frozen plasma and/or platelets should be reserved for patients with documented defects in coagulation. Thrombelastography is useful for the detection and management of coagulation defects associated with intraoperative blood loss.",yes

T4 and T8 lymphocyte subsets were found to be reduced in each of 13 lymphocytopenic platelet donors tested but T4/T8 ratios were similar to those of controls (2.51 +/- 0.79 and 2.33 +/- 0.58 respectively). No adverse effects on platelet donor health were observed but it is suggested that platelet apheresis protocols should be designed to minimize lymphocyte loss.",yes
